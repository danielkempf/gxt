# Glossary

- **GXT** — *Game Exchange Token.* The overall format + tools we defined for sharing signed game/mod messages as short strings.
- **Token** — A string that starts with `gxt:` and contains Base58btc-encoded, Brotli-compressed CBOR bytes.
- **CBOR** — *Concise Binary Object Representation.* A compact, binary JSON-like format.
- **Base58btc** — A human-friendly base encoding that avoids visually ambiguous characters; used for copy/paste in chats.
- **Brotli** — A compression algorithm used to reduce token size; we fix quality=5, lgwin=20.
- **Ed25519** — A modern elliptic-curve signature scheme; used to sign tokens.
- **blake3** — A fast cryptographic hash function; we use it to compute the token’s stable `id` from canonical bytes.
- **bytes0** — The canonical CBOR encoding of the top-level array `[v, pk, payload, id, sig]` **with `id` and `sig` set to empty byte strings**. This is what we hash and sign.
- **`id`** — A 32-byte BLAKE3 hash of `bytes0`. Serves as a stable, content-addressed identifier for the token.
- **`sig`** — A 64-byte Ed25519 signature over `b\"GXT1\" || bytes0` (domain-separated to avoid cross-protocol reuse).
- **`pk`** — The signer’s 32-byte Ed25519 public key.
- **`v`** — Protocol version (currently `1`). Stored *inside* the CBOR array; the outside prefix stays `gxt:`.
- **`payload`** — A two-slot CBOR array of the form `["id", meta]` or `["msg", { parent?, body? }]`.
  - **`meta`** — Opaque CBOR/JSON value carried by an identity token.
  - **`parent`** — Optional 32-byte `id` of a previous token (threading or referencing).
  - **`body`** — Opaque CBOR/JSON payload of a message token.
- **Identity token** — A token whose payload is `["id", meta]`. Used to share a public identity with optional metadata.
- **Message token** — A token whose payload is `["msg", { parent?, body? }]`. Used for trades, quests, etc.
- **Domain separation** — Prefixing the signature preimage with a constant (`GXT1`) to prevent signature reuse across contexts.
- **Self-addressed** — The token includes an `id` derived from its own canonical content (content addressing).
